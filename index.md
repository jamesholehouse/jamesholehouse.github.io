I'm a postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and I completed my PhD in Mathematical Biology at the University of Edinburgh. I obtained a first-class honors degree in Theoretical Physics (MPhys) from the University of Edinburgh. My main interests span several aspects of complexity science and statistical physics:
- Stochasticity and its non-intuitive consequences.
- The effects of randomness on gene expression.
- Rules and regulations across different complex systems.
- Social choice and complexity economics.
Examples of these interests include work on time-dependent solutions of master equations in mathematical biology and economics, and recent work on the evolution of rules and regulations in documents such as the US Code.

All my publications are either open-science or else can be accessed on the *arXiv* or *bioarXiv* (or send me an email and I'll send you the article).You can access my full CV [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/James_Holehouse_CV_new.pdf). Feel free contact me at [jamesholehouse1@gmail.com](mailto:jamesholehouse1@gmail.com), I'm always free for discussion of cool topics!
