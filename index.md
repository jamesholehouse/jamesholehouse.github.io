I'm James, a postdoc researcher at the Santa Fe Institute. I completed my PhD in Mathematical Biology, supervised by Prof. Ramon Grima. Much of my research has centred on stochastic gene expression, although I have also engaged with topics as diverse as enzyme kinetics, social choice models and cross situational learning.

Currently in my postdoc I will look to explain scaling behaviours in regulatory networks. I am also still engaged in projects on analytics and inference in models of stochastic gene expression. All my publications can be accessed on the arXiv where they are not already freely available. Feel free contact me at [jamesholehouse1@gmail.com], I'm always free for discussion and collaboration. You can access my full CV [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/James_Holehouse_CV-1.pdf).
