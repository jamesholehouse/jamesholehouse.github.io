I'm James, a postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute. I completed my PhD in Mathematical Biology, supervised by Prof. Ramon Grima at the University of Edinburgh. Much of my research has centred on stochastic gene expression, although I have also engaged with topics as diverse as enzyme kinetics, social choice models and cross situational learning.

In my postdoc I will look to explain scaling behaviours in regulatory networks. I am also still engaged in projects on analytics and inference in models of stochastic gene expression. All my publications are either open-science or else can be accessed on the *arXiv* or *bioarXiv* (or send me an email and I'll send you the article). Feel free contact me at [jamesholehouse1@gmail.com](mailto:jamesholehouse1@gmail.com), I'm always free for discussion and collaboration. You can access my full CV [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/James_Holehouse_CV-3.pdf).
