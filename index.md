I'm James, a postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute! I completed my PhD in Mathematical Biology at the University of Edinburgh. I obtained a first-class honors degree in Theoretical Physics (MPhys) from the University of Edinburgh. My main interests span several aspects of complexity science and statistical physics:

- Stochasticity and its non-intuitive consequences.
- The effects of randomness on gene expression.
- Rules and regulations across different complex systems.

Examples of these interests include work on time-dependent solutions of master equations in [mathematical biology](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/160/7/074105/3265723) and [social choice](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-072X/ac8c78), explorations of [transient modalities](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/153/16/164113/200374/Stochastic-time-dependent-enzyme-kinetics-Closed?redirectedFrom=fulltext) in stochastic processes that are not due to competing modes of behavior, and recent work on the evolution of rules and regulations in documents such as the [US Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/uscode/2022/) or in [sports](https://sportsrulesproject.com/).

All my publications are either open-science or else can be accessed on the *arXiv* or *bioarXiv* (or send me an email and I'll send you the article). You can access my full CV [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/James_Holehouse_CV_new.pdf), and a video lay summary of some of my research [here](https://youtu.be/Ue8k1t9kHWI?si=GCjJhQlR7yOBfNob) (made by the talented [Pedro Marquez-Zacarias](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/pedro-marquez-zacarias)). Please get in touchâ€”I'm always free for discussion of cool topics!
