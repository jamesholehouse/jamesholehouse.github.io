title: "IC2S2 presentation on diversity and specialization across social and biological systems"
---

Recently, I presented work on the *Scaling of diversity and specialization across socioeconomic and biological complex systems* at IC2S2 in Philadelphia as a contributed talk.
This work has been in a long time in the making with Vicky Chuqiao Yang, Hyejin Youn, Chris Kempes, Ignacio Arroyo, Sidney Redner and
Geoffrey West!

In summary: diversity is all around us! Cities, companies, ecosystems, cells, proteins and at many other levels. Modeling these systems at the appropriate level of analysis is vital to understanding their properties---diversity at the level of proteins does not help describe diversity at the level of ecosystems or cities [1]. But perhaps the structure of diversity shares similar properties? 
In this work we look to describe these multiple levels of diversity using a unifying framework, based on a modified Yule-Simon [2], network growth-like [3], model. Recently compiled data across cities, federal agencies and proteins allows us to see how systems diversity and specialize as they get larger.
This gives us a framework to see how changes in diversity and specialization affect organization structure. Look for our pre-print coming out soon!
