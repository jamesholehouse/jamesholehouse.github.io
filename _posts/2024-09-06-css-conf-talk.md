title: "Talk at the Complex Systems Society conference in Exeter"
---

In Exeter at the Complex Systems Society conference I presented my work with Sid Redner on "first-passage on disordered intervals" that was recently published in Physical Review E. The slides for the talk can be accessed 
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1asymVA49hI5iJmFIkj4PzI441PoklVtN2JeNrUPOpns/edit?usp=sharing). In the same session that I was presenting in there were a couple of stand-out talks, that of Joseph Bradley (CSH Vienna & KCL) on momentum portfolios and that of Paolo Barucca (UCL) using random matrix theory to understand complicated Ornstin-Uhlenbeck processes. Check out their work!
