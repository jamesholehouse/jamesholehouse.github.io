title: "Talk on Ruin Problems at the London Mathematical Labratory's Ergodicity Economics seminar series"
---

This week I gave a talk on the relationship between first-passage time problems and ruin problems. This is in relation to two projects that I am engaged with, (1) [first-passage on disordered intervals](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.L032102) (with Sid Redner), and (2) the origins of transient bimodality (a project in progress with Augustinas Sukys and Kaan Ã–cal).
It was great fun to explore the overlap between first-passage and ruin problems, and I'd like to thank the LML, especially James King and Emilie Soysal, for interesting questions and discussion. You can find a recording of the talk [here](https://streamyard.com/watch/rX5JKWdcKYEt)!
