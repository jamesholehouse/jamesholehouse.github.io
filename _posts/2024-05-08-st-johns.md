title: "Talk and seminar series at St. Johns College, Santa Fe"
---

Alongside [Mahmoud Jalloh](https://philpeople.org/profiles/mahmoud-jalloh), a fellow at St. Johns College in Santa Fe, NM, I organized a short seminar series at St. Johns College on work being done by postdocs at the Santa Fe Institute. It consisted of two talks: one by [Anna Guerrero](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/anna-guerrero) on "What do scientific images represent?" (with the associated reading [1]); and a second by myself on "A complexity approach to rules, regulations and bureaucracy" (with the associated reading [2], see the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MLYKqXSFEspa9pyqD23wD_aITqsk5LKNnkqlCAYZALY/edit?usp=sharing)). There are hopes for this to continue in the new academic year and it was great to connect two local hubs of academia!
