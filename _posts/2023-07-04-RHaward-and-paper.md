title: "Awarded the Reinhart Heinrich Award for best thesis in Mathematical Biology from ESMTB"
---

Two weeks ago I was awarded the Reinhart Heinrich award from the [European Society for Mathematical Biology](https://www.esmtb.org/page-18082) for "his contribution on developing novel analytical and computational techniques for stochastic systems, including model reduction, 
considering time-dependent processes with applications in gene expression and beyond." I will be giving a plenary talk on the thesis at the European Conference for Mathematical Biology 2024 in Toledo, Spain.

In other news, I recently published a paper on Recurrence Relations and Eigenfunction methods in non-trivial models of discrete social choice in Entropy. Find it [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/7/996)!
