title: "Talk at lab of Prof. Hernan Garcia at UC Berkeley"
---

On 07/10/2024 I gave a talk at the lab of Hernan Garcia at UC Berkeley, invited by lab member Brandon Schlomann, on work from my PhD thesis and recent pre-print on "Principles of bursty mRNA expression and irreversibility in single cells and extrinsically varying populations". For those unfamiliar with Hernan's work, his lab studies the biophysics and stochasticity of gene expression using a variety of theoretical and experimental techniques, and his lab has some amazing real-time live imaging data of expression in *drosophia* cells that really is at the cutting edge of the field. You can access the slides from the talk [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qncq53ELN3Hjlx9gK0yH1stllfO0VmHoPI_c_Xt3M9Q/edit?usp=sharing). A snippet from the talk is shown below!
