Recently I was awarded my PhD in Quantitative and Mathematical Biology for my thesis on stochastic modelling in gene expression, 
enzyme kinetics and social choice models conducted under [Prof. Ramon Grima](https://grimagroup.bio.ed.ac.uk/ramon-grima). You can access the thesis [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/PhD_Thesis-8.pdf).
