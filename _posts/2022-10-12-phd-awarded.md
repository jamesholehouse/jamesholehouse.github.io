title: "PhD awarded for thesis \"Model reduction, mechanistic modelling and transience in models of stochastic chemical kinetics\" "
---

Recently I was awarded my PhD in Quantitative and Mathematical Biology from the University of Edinburgh for my thesis on stochastic modelling in gene expression, 
enzyme kinetics and social choice models conducted under [Prof. Ramon Grima](https://grimagroup.bio.ed.ac.uk/ramon-grima). You can access the thesis [here](https://jamesholehouse.github.io/assets/PhD_Thesis-8.pdf). Thanks go to [EASTBIO](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/) and the University of Edinburgh for funding my PhD.
