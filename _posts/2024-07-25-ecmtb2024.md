title: "Plenary talk and contributed talk at ECMTB 2024"
---

This week at the European Conference for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ECMTB 2024) I presented two talks: a mini-symposium talk on work from my recent [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897) using entropy production rates to potentially explain some economic aspects of transcriptional bursting (thanks to Carine Legrand for the invitation!); and a plenary talk on work from my PhD thesis in reception of the [Reinhart-Heinrich award](https://www.esmtb.org/Reinhart-Heinrich-Award) for the best thesis in Mathematical Biology. I was very happy to see some of my core points on the failures of deterministic modelling, the non-intuitive consequences of stochasticity, the difficulties of doing a PhD (and the roles we should play) and the importance of "spin-off" projects resonating with so much of the ESMTB community!

You can access the slides from my talk [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m6kPdZRNR-LoytKl_DiLxalhyJ0WI_STb-sLuvnZN9E/edit?usp=sharing). I'm very happy to discuss more about the contents of the talk, please just send an email my way.
